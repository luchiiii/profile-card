          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Okwuosa Oluchi, a passionate front-end developer dedicated
            to creating accessible and user-friendly web experiences. My journey
            into tech started with curiosity about how beautiful websites are
            built, and it has grown into a deep passion for crafting digital
            experiences that everyone can enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring skincare and fashion
            content, diving into African literature novels, or learning about
            personal finance. I believe in continuous learning and bringing
            creativity into everything I do.

        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence" class="about-section">
          <h2>Areas I'm Working to Improve</h2>
          <p>
            Growth comes from acknowledging areas where we need improvement.
            Here are the areas where I'm building more confidence:
          </p>
          <ul class="confidence-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Complex JavaScript algorithms:</strong> While I'm
              comfortable with frontend logic, I'm working on strengthening my
              problem-solving skills with more complex algorithms and data
              structures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Backend integration:</strong> I want to become more
              confident in connecting frontend applications with APIs and
              understanding the full stack.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Speaking up in technical discussions:</strong> Sometimes I
              second-guess myself in group settings. I'm working on trusting my
              knowledge and contributing more actively.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance optimization:</strong> I want to deepen my
              understanding of web performance metrics and optimization
              techniques.
            </li>

          <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
          <div class="future-note">
            <p>Dear Future Oluchi,</p>
            <p>
              Remember this moment when you were excited, nervous, and ready to
              learn. You're taking this step because you believe in yourself and
              your ability to grow. Don't forget how far you've come already!
            </p>
            <p>
              When things get challenging (and they will), remember that every
              expert was once a beginner. Every bug you solve makes you
              stronger. Every project you complete adds to your skills. Be
              patient with yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep learning, stay curious, and never stop creating. You're
              building something amazingâ€”not just code, but a career and a life
              you're proud of. Trust the process, celebrate small wins, and
              remember why you started.
            </p>
            <p>You've got this! ðŸ’ª</p>
            <p class="signature">â€” Oluchi (Today)</p>

          <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond my technical goals, I'm excited about the community aspect of
            this program. I believe that the connections we make and the
            collaborations we build are just as valuable as the technical skills
            we gain.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm committed to contributing positively to this community, sharing
            what I learn, helping others where I can, and staying open to
            feedback. Technology is constantly evolving, and I want to be
            someone who embraces change and grows with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also mindful of maintaining balance. While I'm dedicated to
            becoming an excellent developer, I also value my hobbies, my health,
            and my relationships. Success isn't just about codeâ€”it's about
            building a life that's fulfilling in every way.
